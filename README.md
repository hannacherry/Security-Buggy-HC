# Security-Buggy-HC
Security Buggy
This project was made by Hanna, Keiron, Peyton, and Reagan. (Freshman from Chester County High School TN) We created a robot buggy that uses a distance sensor. At first we were going to use a motion sensor, but we didn't have the materials to set it up. We had a couple issues getting the sensor to work and making sure the motors wouldn't stop running but the project mostly got finished. Through this project our group learned how hard it is to code, but looking back at what we actually got done, it was fun. We learned a lot about working as a team too.
